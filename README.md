# Demo Library Service

## Intro

We've prepared a simple Koa app which acts like an API making a call to a downstream data service. The app is akin to something used by a library to track details on books, borrowings, and fines.
The downstream service call is mocked with the `downstream-fixtures/all-books.json` file to mimic the use of an API/database.

There are unit tests for the majority of functionality and integration tests for the `/books` route already implemented. These are written using Jest.

## Tasks

Initially, we would like you to ensure the service fulfills the following requirements:

  1) List all available books âœ…
  2) Filter books by their title
  3) Filter books by their author
  4) Filter books by their classification
  5) Filter books by their category
  6) Handle mapping books with a `null` blurb


Additional requirements have arisen for an endpoint that generates some metrics for a specific book (found via by ISBN):

  1) The number of times borrowed
  2) The average length of borrowing
  3) The number of times the book has become overdue
